Banner of peace: disable ALL DAMAGE in its area


 The Scavenger's Grinder (Trinket/Curio Slot)
   Appearance: A small, gear-like amulet.
   Function: While worn, it gives common mob drops a chance to be automatically "re-rolled" into something better upon pickup.
   When you pick up Rotten Flesh, there's a 30% chance it instantly becomes Leather.
   When you pick up a Bone or Arrow, there's a 20% chance to get an extra one.
   When you pick up String, there's a 40% chance it becomes Wool.
   The Catch: On every successful conversion, there is a tiny chance (1%) that the Grinder "jams," dealing half a heart of damage to you and making a loud, unpleasant gear-grinding noise.
   Why it fits: A fantastic passive utility that makes grinding mobs more rewarding, but it carries a small, persistent risk that can chip away at you over time. It's the "death by a thousand cuts" philosophy.
   Flavor Text: "Not all that is rotten is lost. Some of it just needs a good crunch."

Bottled Midas Touch (Splash Potion)
Appearance: A splash potion with a swirling, golden liquid.
Function: When thrown, it doesn't harm entities. Instead, it affects blocks. It has a chance to "upgrade" common blocks in its splash radius to a more valuable variant.
Cobblestone -> Iron Ore
Stone -> Coal Ore
Iron Ore -> Gold Ore
Gold Ore -> Diamond Ore
The chance is not guaranteed for every block, making each splash a gamble. There's also a tiny chance for a "misfire," turning a small number of blocks into pure Gold Blocks, or a "dud," where nothing happens at all.
Why it fits: It's a direct, visible gamble on your resources. Do you throw it at a wall of stone hoping for a bit of coal, or do you risk it on your hard-won iron ore for a shot at gold?
Flavor Text: "Wealth is just a matter of perspective... and a little alchemy."


Vagabond's Boots (Armor)
   Appearance: Worn-looking leather or chainmail boots.
   Function: These boots have a unique, inverse relationship with your health. The lower your current health, the faster you move.
   Full Health: Normal speed.
   Half Health: Speed I effect.
   2 Hearts or less: Speed II effect.
   Why it fits: It's the ultimate "desperate escape" item. It does nothing for you when you're safe, but becomes incredibly powerful when you're on the verge of death. It encourages and rewards risky plays and dramatic getaways.
   Flavor Text: "You're never faster than when you're running for your life."


The Eye of Horus (Helmet or Trinket)
Appearance: A golden eye emblem on a headband or helmet.
Function: While worn, it grants you a permanent Night Vision effect. This is an incredible utility for caving and nighttime exploration.
The Catch: It creates a "supernatural debt." For every 10 minutes you wear it, it adds one "phantom" to a hidden counter. The next time you sleep, that many Phantoms will spawn and attack you immediately upon waking up, regardless of how long it's been since you last slept.
Why it fits: It offers an amazing convenience but with a deferred, dangerous consequence. You can use it to explore safely for hours, but you know a difficult fight is waiting for you the next time you need to reset your spawn.
Flavor Text: "It lets you see in the dark, but the dark sees you, too."
